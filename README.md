# bmt (brian's module tool)

This is my tool for managing my Perl modules. It's specifically
designed for the way that I like to do things.

* [Makefile.PL as a modulino](https://www.masteringperl.org/2015/01/makefile-pl-as-a-modulino/)
* I store repos in GitHub, Bitbucket, and GitLab at the same time ([Use several Git Services at Once](https://briandfoy.github.io/use-several-git-services-at-once/))
